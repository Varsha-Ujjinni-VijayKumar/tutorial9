# Section 2 : Sexual Assault

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
crime <- read_csv("Data_Tables_Criminal_Incidents_Visualisation_Year_Ending_December_2019 (1).csv")
```

In the past 10 years, there have been 5 categories of cases of sexual harassment. From Table \ref(tab:tableA30) we know that indecent assault was the most frequently reported case with a total of 28783 cases. In addition, rape became the second most frequent case with 25007 cases. While cases of child abuse exceed incest cases, and other sexual cases.


```{r tableA30, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
crimesexual <-crime %>% filter(`Offence Subdivision`== "A30 Sexual offences")
crimesexual %>% select(-c(`Year ending`)) %>%
  group_by(`Offence Subgroup`) %>%
    summarise(total=sum(`Incidents Recorded`)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  kable(caption = "Total case of Sexual Offences from 2010-2019")%>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

To see the development of cases in the last 10 years, a graph has been presented. From figure \ref(fig:plotA30) in general, there is an increase in cases each year. Incident assault increased sharply and reached a peak around 2016 and decreased gradually. Significant increase was also experienced by rape cases which reached their peak in 2019.
Sexual violence against children increases slowly while other violence overtakes incest at the end of 2016 and increases significantly until 2019.

```{r plotA30, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Graph of incident recorded of sexual assault over time"}

crimesexual %>% ggplot(aes(x= Year,
                     y=`Incidents Recorded`,
                     colour = `Offence Subgroup`)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
